# Burning Crusade Classic beta mechanics

See https://github.com/magey/tbc-warrior for warrior-specific or general interest things such as armor or experience.  Anything related to paladins, druids, really any mechanics that don't fit into magey's are fine here!

Feel free to open issues for bug reports and for suggesting mechanics/behaviors to research. Be sure to specificy the beta build number or the date the test/video was taken because things can drastically change between builds.
